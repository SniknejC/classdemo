         <p class="larger">When the mountain dam high above their home breaks, destroying the Pesca Village and its people, fraternal twins Naru and Nava are both devastated by the event. Believing that each is the tribe's sole surviver, the siblings are separated by fate and taken in by other villages some distance apart. In his new village, Naru is forced to deny his training as a shaman, and Nava takes on the role as a caretaker to a mentally-ill couple with potentially devastating consequences. This is a story of redemption, forgiveness, and ultimately the healing power of love. Publication date Summer of 2014.</p>

Through the eyes of a feisty feline, readers get a humorous glimpse into how changing our perceptions can help us to find a deeper connection with the earth and those around us, at the same time, nurturing, and greater compassion and love within ourselves. <a href="http://amzn.to/16Flovv">See more.</a></p>
